In fact, those of us who were already using D\\* when GPlus came out were quite familiar with its layout and functionality. It was almost as if they had started developing by grabbing D\\* code and stripping out federation.\r\n\r\nWhen I say federated, I mean that there is not one central Diaspora\\* server (or server cluster) that all users belong to. Instead, there are many [Diaspora\\* servers](http://podupti.me/) to choose from, with different operators ( #podmin), privacy policies, terms of service, and so on. Federation works much like when you decide to mail someone. It doesn't matter to me whether you use Gmail, Hotmail, Ymail, or GMX. I can send messages to you because electronic mail is federated. It is the same way with Diaspora\\*. You may be on [JoinDiaspora](http://joindiaspora.com/), [Calispora](http://calispora.org/), [Diasp.org](http://diasp.org/), [Diasp.eu](http://diasp.eu/), [Serendipitous](http://ser.endipito.us/) or another pod. You can still connect to people whose accounts are on other pods.\r\n\r\nI have written before about [federation](https://joindiaspora.com/posts/1679098).\r\n\r\nThis is an advantage, because it means that you're not beholden to a single organization's policies. If you decide that you dislike the _podmin_ on Pod X, you can open an account on Pod Y instead or even set up your own pod. (_**Moving** your account is not yet implemented_, but I believe you can export your contacts and use the export to help you repopulate that list on your new pod.) If podmin X decides to shut down pod X, again you can open an account on another pod or host your own.\r\n\r\n## @ mentions\r\n\r\nHit the at-sign and the first few letters of the person's display name (it used to be the first few of the person's username, but then they decided to hide that ... personally, I wish they'd switch back)\r\n\r\nWhen you mention someone, make sure you set the privacy to include the group that person is in. There was a bug (possibly fixed) where you could mention someone in a post they weren't allowed to see. I do not believe that @ mentions work in comments yet.\r\n\r\nTwitter, where at-mentions were invented (by users and 3rd-party clients) doesn't have the problem of at-mentions affecting groups simply because it does not have any form of privacy groups.\r\n\r\n## Hashtags\r\n\r\nDiaspora\\* supports #hashtags. Because your pod intercepts them, being on a bigger pod means that clicking a hashtag will give a larger results set than if you clicked on the hashtag from a smaller pod. It is a known problem of the current federation mechanism, and is being fixed.\r\n\r\nTwitter, where hashtags were invented (by users and 3rd-party clients), doesn't have this problem only because everyone is one the same instance of T. #StatusNet, which is like a federated clone of #Twitter, also has the same issue to some degree.\r\n\r\n## Aspects\r\n\r\nPrivacy groups for posts; these were the obvious inspiration for #GPlus's circles, and they work similarly. For example, you may wish to place your boss and others that you know from work into a work aspect. You may also wish to place people you know from college, church, or other such activities into aspects specific to their roles in your life, and to place family members into aspects specific to people in that role.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't already understand aspects, consider this: if posts are wide-open, anyone who becomes a contact can see them. So if you have your boss as a contact, and you post a photo of your trip to the beach won a day you called in sick, _you may get fired for stupidity_. What you do is you put your boss into a work aspect, and only post things into that aspect that are acceptable in a work context.\r\n\r\n## Posting syntax\r\n\r\nDiaspora\\* uses something called [Markdown](http://www.simpleeditions.com/59001/markdown-an-introduction) for its posts. Most of the time, you can just post in plain text and not worry about it, but every once in a while, Markdown will distort what you've posted.\r\n\r\nMarkdown does give you the ability to _italicize_, **bold**, and otherwise decorate text and to embed links and images using a fairly simple syntax. I find, however, that I have to look up embedding every time I use it.\r\n\r\n(I personally prefer [Textile](http://textile.thresholdstate.com/). You still have to learn to use it effectively, but it more closely matches what experienced net users have grown to expect from applications like Outlook and Thunderbird. For instance, if I want bold text, surround it with single asterisks [\\*] rather than the double asterisks [\\*\\*] that Markdown requires.)\r\n\r\n## Pods\r\n\r\nA Diaspora\\* pod is the server or server cluster where your account resides. There are dozens or even hundreds of pods out there. Most of them are pretty similar in what they offer. A few offer experimental features, such as post previews, pod-only posts, or encrypted messaging. It is my hope that many of these features will be picked up by the main codebase, so that all pods will have them.\r\n\r\nYou'll rarely need to know this, but every Diaspora\\* account has an address that looks like username@podname.com. If you want people to be able to add you as a contact, publish your Diaspora\\* address. They'll be able to add you that way.\r\n\r\n## Facebook\r\n\r\nAll of the pods I have used have the ability to connect to certain external accounts, such as Twitter and #Facebook. This means that you can post from D\\* to FB or T. You don't have to abandon your \"friends\" on other #socnets because you join D\\*.\r\n\r\nIf you read many online articles, you will come across some that seem to believe that Diaspora\\*'s purpose is to become a Facebook-killer. Do not believe them. If and when people tire of Facebook, it will be because of something that FB does, not because socnet X is better. If you look at D\\* as a substitute for Facebook, it will be like a meat-eater who tries to replace meat with soy-based meat substitutes. You won't like it. Instead, I recommend that you get to know people who are on D\\* and that you invite your existing contacts, but that you **enjoy D\\* for its own value**. If you find that it then makes FB unnecessary, that is good. If, on the other hand, you still want to keep your FB account, that is also good.\r\n\r\n## Controversies\r\n\r\nThere are occasional squabbles over the directions the project is taking. Unlike the squabbles at Twitter, which took place behind closed doors and resulted in a number of highly-skilled people leaving and the recently announced restrictions on how client applications can display Twitter-sourced content, Diaspora\\*'s squabbles tend to happen in public. My advice is simple: stay out of the squabbles, find your own philosophical point of view, and support this and any other project that agrees with that point of view. If the time comes when this or any other project no longer fits your POV, leave quietly.\r\n\r\nWhen I felt that GPlus was hostile to my POV, I closed my accounts. When I felt that Facebook was hostile to my POV, I closed my account. I do not go around trash-talking either project, or assuming that anyone in said projects is intentionally \"evil,\" and I would not recommend doing that to D\\* or any other project.\r\n\r\n## Future\r\n\r\nAt some point in the future, the Diaspora\\* developers will be changing the federation protocol. Federation is what enables a user on Pod X to interact with users on pods Y, Z, etc. They are working to improve scalability (ability to handle more content posted from more users in the same period of time) and content dispersion (ability for content to travel between a wider number of pods seamlessly). It is a tough task. If you are interested in #Ruby programming or Ruby on Rails ( #RoR ), I would encourage you to get involved.\r\n\r\nThey are also planning to make D\\* a far more visual-oriented socnet. That means that posts with images, graphics, and video will be far more interesting, and will be displayed in a manner that caters to those things. There is an experimental pod where they test out many of the visual designs that may make it into the D* codebase. I will not link it here, because people may misunderstand that it is experimental and not really intended to be your home pod.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in the technical side and the future directions, they have a moderated and directed code-chat on IRC every (other?) Thursday at 10AM Pacific in the room #diaspora-meeting on Freenode. Sean can jump in on the comments to correct me on this.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis is long, but I think this is a good intro to Diaspora\\*. I wish there had been someone who could write something like this when I joined. I should also put in a disclaimer. This is my personal opinion, and not the official stance of any podmin or of the Diaspora\\* developers. You are free to disagree, but please start a new thread for it. This is posted in the hope that people who newly join Diaspora\\* will get a head start.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of tutorials at [Diasporal](http://diasporial.com/). I would encourage you to visit the site and check them out. If you are a blogger, or if you write for a magazine (online or dead-tree), I would encourage you to write about Diaspora\\* once you've taken some time to get to know the place.","public":true,"created_at":"2012-07-05T09:37:15Z","interacted_at":"2012-07-05T09:37:15Z","provider_display_name":null,"post_type":"Reshare","image_url":null,"object_url":null,"favorite":false,"nsfw":false,"author":{"id":2,"guid":"7445f9a0a6c28ebb","name":"Florian Staudacher","diaspora_id":"raven24@pod.fulll.name","avatar":{"small":"https://pod.fulll.name/uploads/images/thumb_small_5f612f44a0a026b119f8.png","medium":"https://pod.fulll.name/uploads/images/thumb_medium_5f612f44a0a026b119f8.png","large":"https://pod.fulll.name/uploads/images/thumb_large_5f612f44a0a026b119f8.png"}},"o_embed_cache":null,"mentioned_people":[],"photos":[],"frame_name":"status","root":{"id":11730,"guid":"57288b4adf721900","text":"# Intro To Using Diaspora\\*\r\n\r\n## Federated Social Networking\r\n\r\nDiaspora\\* is a social network (socnet), similar in many ways to Facebook, #MySpace, #Orkut, and Google Plus ( #GPlus).

It was almost as if they had started developing by grabbing D\\* code and stripping out federation.\r\n\r\nWhen I say federated, I mean that there is not one central Diaspora\\* server (or server cluster) that all users belong to. Instead, there are many [Diaspora\\* servers](http://podupti.me/) to choose from, with different operators ( #podmin), privacy policies, terms of service, and so on. Federation works much like when you decide to mail someone. It doesn't matter to me whether you use Gmail, Hotmail, Ymail, or GMX. I can send messages to you because electronic mail is federated. It is the same way with Diaspora\\*. You may be on [JoinDiaspora](http://joindiaspora.com/), [Calispora](http://calispora.org/), [Diasp.org](http://diasp.org/), [Diasp.eu](http://diasp.eu/), [Serendipitous](http://ser.endipito.us/) or another pod. You can still connect to people whose accounts are on other pods.\r\n\r\nI have written before about [federation](https://joindiaspora.com/posts/1679098).\r\n\r\nThis is an advantage, because it means that you're not beholden to a single organization's policies. If you decide that you dislike the _podmin_ on Pod X, you can open an account on Pod Y instead or even set up your own pod. (_**Moving** your account is not yet implemented_, but I believe you can export your contacts and use the export to help you repopulate that list on your new pod.) If podmin X decides to shut down pod X, again you can open an account on another pod or host your own.\r\n\r\n## @ mentions\r\n\r\nHit the at-sign and the first few letters of the person's display name (it used to be the first few of the person's username, but then they decided to hide that ... personally, I wish they'd switch back)\r\n\r\nWhen you mention someone, make sure you set the privacy to include the group that person is in. There was a bug (possibly fixed) where you could mention someone in a post they weren't allowed to see. I do not believe that @ mentions work in comments yet.\r\n\r\nTwitter, where at-mentions were invented (by users and 3rd-party clients) doesn't have the problem of at-mentions affecting groups simply because it does not have any form of privacy groups.\r\n\r\n## Hashtags\r\n\r\nDiaspora\\* supports #hashtags. Because your pod intercepts them, being on a bigger pod means that clicking a hashtag will give a larger results set than if you clicked on the hashtag from a smaller pod. It is a known problem of the current federation mechanism, and is being fixed.\r\n\r\nTwitter, where hashtags were invented (by users and 3rd-party clients), doesn't have this problem only because everyone is one the same instance of T. #StatusNet, which is like a federated clone of #Twitter, also has the same issue to some degree.\r\n\r\n## Aspects\r\n\r\nPrivacy groups for posts; these were the obvious inspiration for #GPlus's circles, and they work similarly. For example, you may wish to place your boss and others that you know from work into a work aspect. You may also wish to place people you know from college, church, or other such activities into aspects specific to their roles in your life, and to place family members into aspects specific to people in that role.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't already understand aspects, consider this: if posts are wide-open, anyone who becomes a contact can see them. So if you have your boss as a contact, and you post a photo of your trip to the beach won a day you called in sick, _you may get fired for stupidity_. What you do is you put your boss into a work aspect, and only post things into that aspect that are acceptable in a work context.\r\n\r\n## Posting syntax\r\n\r\nDiaspora\\* uses something called [Markdown](http://www.simpleeditions.com/59001/markdown-an-introduction) for its posts. Most of the time, you can just post in plain text and not worry about it, but every once in a while, Markdown will distort what you've posted.\r\n\r\nMarkdown does give you the ability to _italicize_, **bold**, and otherwise decorate text and to embed links and images using a fairly simple syntax. I find, however, that I have to look up embedding every time I use it.\r\n\r\n(I personally prefer [Textile](http://textile.thresholdstate.com/). You still have to learn to use it effectively, but it more closely matches what experienced net users have grown to expect from applications like Outlook and Thunderbird. For instance, if I want bold text, surround it with single asterisks [\\*] rather than the double asterisks [\\*\\*] that Markdown requires.)\r\n\r\n## Pods\r\n\r\nA Diaspora\\* pod is the server or server cluster where your account resides. There are dozens or even hundreds of pods out there. Most of them are pretty similar in what they offer. A few offer experimental features, such as post previews, pod-only posts, or encrypted messaging. It is my hope that many of these features will be picked up by the main codebase, so that all pods will have them.\r\n\r\nYou'll rarely need to know this, but every Diaspora\\* account has an address that looks like username@podname.com. If you want people to be able to add you as a contact, publish your Diaspora\\* address. They'll be able to add you that way.\r\n\r\n## Facebook\r\n\r\nAll of the pods I have used have the ability to connect to certain external accounts, such as Twitter and #Facebook. This means that you can post from D\\* to FB or T. You don't have to abandon your \"friends\" on other #socnets because you join D\\*.\r\n\r\nIf you read many online articles, you will come across some that seem to believe that Diaspora\\*'s purpose is to become a Facebook-killer. Do not believe them. If and when people tire of Facebook, it will be because of something that FB does, not because socnet X is better. If you look at D\\* as a substitute for Facebook, it will be like a meat-eater who tries to replace meat with soy-based meat substitutes. You won't like it. Instead, I recommend that you get to know people who are on D\\* and that you invite your existing contacts, but that you **enjoy D\\* for its own value**. If you find that it then makes FB unnecessary, that is good. If, on the other hand, you still want to keep your FB account, that is also good.\r\n\r\n## Controversies\r\n\r\nThere are occasional squabbles over the directions the project is taking. Unlike the squabbles at Twitter, which took place behind closed doors and resulted in a number of highly-skilled people leaving and the recently announced restrictions on how client applications can display Twitter-sourced content, Diaspora\\*'s squabbles tend to happen in public. My advice is simple: stay out of the squabbles, find your own philosophical point of view, and support this and any other project that agrees with that point of view. If the time comes when this or any other project no longer fits your POV, leave quietly.\r\n\r\nWhen I felt that GPlus was hostile to my POV, I closed my accounts. When I felt that Facebook was hostile to my POV, I closed my account. I do not go around trash-talking either project, or assuming that anyone in said projects is intentionally \"evil,\" and I would not recommend doing that to D\\* or any other project.\r\n\r\n## Future\r\n\r\nAt some point in the future, the Diaspora\\* developers will be changing the federation protocol. Federation is what enables a user on Pod X to interact with users on pods Y, Z, etc. They are working to improve scalability (ability to handle more content posted from more users in the same period of time) and content dispersion (ability for content to travel between a wider number of pods seamlessly). It is a tough task. If you are interested in #Ruby programming or Ruby on Rails ( #RoR ), I would encourage you to get involved.\r\n\r\nThey are also planning to make D\\* a far more visual-oriented socnet. That means that posts with images, graphics, and video will be far more interesting, and will be displayed in a manner that caters to those things. There is an experimental pod where they test out many of the visual designs that may make it into the D* codebase. I will not link it here, because people may misunderstand that it is experimental and not really intended to be your home pod.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in the technical side and the future directions, they have a moderated and directed code-chat on IRC every (other?) Thursday at 10AM Pacific in the room #diaspora-meeting on Freenode. Sean can jump in on the comments to correct me on this.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis is long, but I think this is a good intro to Diaspora\\*. I wish there had been someone who could write something like this when I joined. I should also put in a disclaimer. This is my personal opinion, and not the official stance of any podmin or of the Diaspora\\* developers. You are free to disagree, but please start a new thread for it. This is posted in the hope that people who newly join Diaspora\\* will get a head start.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of tutorials at [Diasporal](http://diasporial.com/). I would encourage you to visit the site and check them out. If you are a blogger, or if you write for a magazine (online or dead-tree), I would encourage you to write about Diaspora\\* once you've taken some time to get to know the place.","next_post":"/posts/11730/next","previous_post":"/posts/11730/previous","interactions":{"likes":[],"reshares":[],"comments_count":0,"likes_count":0,"reshares_count":4}},"title":"A post from Florian Staudacher","next_post":"/posts/11774/next","previous_post":"/posts/11774/previous","interactions":{"likes":[],"reshares":[],"comments_count":0,"likes_count":0,"reshares_count":0,"comments":[]}},{"id":11725,"guid":"909471c6070243be","text":"If you think you know of a #Diaspora #Bug please remember to be as specific as possible when describing it so we can help!!","public":true,"created_at":"2012-07-04T23:29:43Z","interacted_at":"2012-07-04T23:29:43Z","provider_display_name":null,"post_type":"Reshare","image_url":null,"object_url":null,"favorite":false,"nsfw":false,"author":{"id":2,"guid":"7445f9a0a6c28ebb","name":"Florian Staudacher","diaspora_id":"raven24@pod.fulll.name","avatar":{"small":"https://pod.fulll.name/uploads/images/thumb_small_5f612f44a0a026b119f8.png","medium":"https://pod.fulll.name/uploads/images/thumb_medium_5f612f44a0a026b119f8.png","large":"https://pod.fulll.name/uploads/images/thumb_large_5f612f44a0a026b119f8.png"}},"o_embed_cache":null,"mentioned_people":[],"photos":[],"frame_name":"status","root":{"id":11718,"guid":"c1770c590b097c28","text":"If you think you know of a #Diaspora #Bug please remember to be as specific as possible when describing it so we can help!!","public":true,"created_at":"2012-07-04T22:00:49Z","interacted_at":"2012-07-05T08:19:07Z","provider_display_name":null,"post_type":"StatusMessage","image_url":null,"object_url":null,"favorite":false,"nsfw":false,"author":{"id":5653,"guid":"7410329c39e6810f","name":"Hans","diaspora_id":"hans@hfase.com","avatar":{"small":"https://hfase.com/uploads/images/thumb_small_f2b2d6b041732c5f91eb.jpg","medium":"https://hfase.com/uploads/images/thumb_medium_f2b2d6b041732c5f91eb.jpg","large":"https://hfase.com/uploads/images/thumb_large_f2b2d6b041732c5f91eb.jpg"}},"o_embed_cache":null,"mentioned_people":[],"photos":[],"frame_name":"status","root":null,"title":"If you think you know of a #Diaspora #Bug please remember to be as specific as possible when describing it so we can help!!","next_post":"/posts/11718/next","previous_post":"/posts/11718/previous","interactions":{"likes":[],"reshares":[{"reshare":{"actor_url":null,"author_id":2,"comments_count":0,"created_at":"2012-07-04T23:29:43Z","diaspora_handle":"raven24@pod.fulll.name","favorite":false,"frame_name":null,"guid":"909471c6070243be","id":11725,"image_height":null,"image_url":null,"image_width":null,"interacted_at":"2012-07-04T23:29:43Z","likes_count":0,"o_embed_cache_id":null,"objectId":null,"object_url":null,"pending":false,"processed_image":null,"provider_display_name":null,"public":true,"random_string":null,"remote_photo_name":null,"remote_photo_path":null,"reshares_count":0,"root_guid":"c1770c590b097c28","status_message_guid":null,"text":null,"unprocessed_image":null,"updated_at":"2012-07-04T23:29:43Z"}}],"comments_count":0,"likes_count":2,"reshares_count":2}},"title":"A post from Florian Staudacher","next_post":"/posts/11725/next","previous_post":"/posts/11725/previous","interactions":{"likes":[],"reshares":[],"comments_count":0,"likes_count":0,"reshares_count":0,"comments":[]}}]

Every public post also has a specific URL that anyone can view, even if they're not logged in - thus public posts may be linked to directly from Twitter, blogs, etc. Public posts may also be indexed by search engines.","can_comment_reshare_like_q":"Who can comment on, reshare, or like my public post?","can_comment_reshare_like_a":"Any logged-in diaspora* user can comment on, reshare, or like your public post.","see_comment_reshare_like_q":"When I comment on, reshare, or like a public post, who can see it?","see_comment_reshare_like_a":"Any logged-in diaspora* user and anyone else on the internet. Comments, likes, and reshares of public posts are also public.","deselect_aspect_posting_q":"What happens when I deselect one or more aspects when making a public post?","deselect_aspect_posting_a":"Deselecting aspects does not affect a public post. It will still appear in the streams of all of your contacts. To make a post visible only to specific aspects, you need to select those aspects from the button under the publisher."},"public_profiles":{"title":"Public profiles","who_sees_profile_q":"Who sees my public profile?","who_sees_profile_a":"Any logged-in diaspora* user, as well as the wider internet, can see it. Each profile has a direct URL, so it may be linked to directly from outside sites. It may be indexed by search engines.","whats_in_profile_q":"What's in my public profile","whats_in_profile_a":"Your name, the five tags you chose to describe yourself, and your photo. It's the stuff in the top section of the edit profile page. You can make this profile information as identifiable or anonymous as you like. Your profile page also shows any public posts you have made.","who_sees_updates_q":"Who sees updates to my public profile?","who_sees_updates_a":"Anyone can see changes if they visit your profile page.","what_do_tags_do_q":"What do the tags on my public profile do?","what_do_tags_do_a":"They help people get to know you. Your profile picture will also appear on the left-hand side of those particular tag pages, along with anyone else who has them in their public profile."},"resharing_posts":{"title":"Resharing posts","reshare_public_post_aspects_q":"Can I reshare a public post with only certain aspects?","reshare_public_post_aspects_a":"No, when you reshare a public post it automatically becomes one of your public posts. To share it with certain aspects, copy and paste the contents of the post into a new post.","reshare_private_post_aspects_q":"Can I reshare a private post with only certain aspects?","reshare_private_post_aspects_a":"No, it is not possible to reshare a private post. This is to respect the intentions of the original poster who only shared it with a particular group of people."},"sharing":{"title":"Sharing","add_to_aspect_q":"What happens when I add someone to one of my aspects? Or when someone adds me to one of their aspects?","add_to_aspect_a1":"Let's say that Amy adds Ben to an aspect, but Ben has not (yet) added Amy to an aspect:","add_to_aspect_li1":"Ben will receive a notification that Amy has \"started sharing\" with Ben.","add_to_aspect_li2":"Amy will start to see Ben's public posts in her stream.","add_to_aspect_li3":"Amy will not see any of Ben's private posts.","add_to_aspect_li4":"Ben will not see Amy's public or private posts in his stream.","add_to_aspect_li5":"But if Ben goes to Amy's profile page, then he will see Amy's private posts that she makes to her aspect that has him in it (as well as her public posts which anyone can see there).","add_to_aspect_li6":"Ben will be able to see Amy's private profile (bio, location, gender, birthday).","add_to_aspect_li7":"Amy will appear under \"Only sharing with me\" on Ben's contacts page.","add_to_aspect_a2":"This is known as asymmetrical sharing. If and when Ben also adds Amy to an aspect then it would become mutual sharing, with both Amy's and Ben's public posts and relevant private posts appearing in each other's streams, etc. ","only_sharing_q":"Who are the people listed in \"Only sharing with me\" on my contacts page?","only_sharing_a":"These are people that have added you to one of their aspects, but who are not (yet) in any of your aspects. In other words, they are sharing with you, but you are not sharing with them (asymmetrical sharing). If you add them to an aspect, they will then appear under that aspect and not under \"only sharing with you\". See above.","list_not_sharing_q":"Is there a list of people whom I have added to one of my aspects, but who have not added me to one of theirs?","list_not_sharing_a":"No, but you can see whether or not someone is sharing with you by visiting their profile page. If they are, the bar under their profile picture will be green; if not, it'll be grey. You should get a notification each time someone starts sharing with you.","see_old_posts_q":"When I add someone to an aspect, can they see older posts that I have already posted to that aspect?","see_old_posts_a":"No. They will only be able to see new posts to that aspect. They (and everyone else) can see your older public posts on your profile page, and they may also see them in their stream."},"tags":{"title":"Tags","what_are_tags_for_q":"What are tags for?","what_are_tags_for_a":"Tags are a way to categorize a post, usually by topic. Searching for a tag shows all posts with that tag that you can see (both public and private posts). This lets people who are interested in a given topic find public posts about it.","tags_in_comments_q":"Can I put tags in comments or just in posts?","tags_in_comments_a":"A tag added to a comment will still appear as a link to that tag's page, but it will not make that post (or comment) appear on that tag page. This only works for tags in posts.","followed_tags_q":"What are \"#Followed Tags\" and how do I follow a tag?","followed_tags_a":"After searching for a tag you can click the button at the top of the tag's page to \"follow\" that tag. It will then appear in your list of followed tags on the left. Clicking one of your followed tags takes you to that tag's page so you can see recent posts containing that tag. Click on #Followed Tags to see a stream of posts that include one of any of your followed tags. ","people_tag_page_q":"Who are the people listed on the left-hand side of a tag page?","people_tag_page_a":"They are people who have listed that tag to describe themselves in their public profile.","filter_tags_q":"How can I filter/exclude some tags from my stream?","filter_tags_a":"This is not yet available directly through diaspora*, but some %{third_party_tools} have been written that might provide this."},"miscellaneous":{"title":"Miscellaneous","back_to_top_q":"Is there a quick way to go back to the top of a page after I scroll down?","back_to_top_a":"Yes. After scrolling down a page, click on the grey arrow that appears in the bottom right corner of your browser window.","photo_albums_q":"Are there photo or video albums?","photo_albums_a":"No, not currently. However you can view a stream of their uploaded pictures from the Photos section in the side-bar of their profile page.","subscribe_feed_q":"Can I subscribe to someone's public posts with a feed reader?","subscribe_feed_a":"Yes, but this is still not a polished feature and the formatting of the results is still pretty rough. If you want to try it anyway, go to someone's profile page and click the feed button in your browser, or you can copy the profile URL (i.e. https://joindiaspora.com/people/somenumber), and paste it into a feed reader. The resulting feed address looks like this: https://joindiaspora.com/public/username.atom Diaspora uses Atom rather than RSS.","diaspora_app_q":"Is there a diaspora* app for Android or iOS?","diaspora_app_a":"There are several Android apps in very early development. Several are long-abandoned projects and so do not work well with the current version of diaspora*. Don't expect much from these apps at the moment. Currently the best way to access diaspora* from your mobile device is through a browser, because we've designed a mobile version of the site which should work well on all devices. There is currently no app for iOS. Again, diaspora* should work fine via your browser."}}, "en");
